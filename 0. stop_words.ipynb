      "SOUTH KOREA MOVES TO SLOW GROWTH OF TRADE SURPLUS South Korea ' s trade surplus is growing too fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it down , Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn - je said . \n",
      "He told a press conference the government planned to increase investment , speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus \" at a proper level .\" But he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in a short period of time . \n",
      "South Korea has been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won . \n",
      "The U . \n",
      "S . \n",
      "Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with the U . \n",
      "S ., Which rose to 7 . \n",
      "4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4 . \n",
      "3 billion dlrs in 1985 . \n",
      "Kim , who is also economic planning minister , said prospects were bright for the South Korean economy , but the government would try to hold the current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next five years . \n",
      "\" Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth , five billion dlrs of ( current account ) surplus and 12 pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year . \n",
      "But now the surplus is growing faster than we expected ,\" he said . \n",
      "Trade ministry officials said South Korea ' s exports rose 35 pct to 9 . \n",
      "34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this year , while imports rose only 8 . \n",
      "5 pct to 8 . \n",
      "2 billion dlrs . \n",
      "Kim said the swing of South Korea ' s current account to a surplus of 4 . \n",
      "65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr deficit in 1985 was very significant . \n",
      "The surplus enabled the country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first time . \n",
      "South Korea ' s foreign debt , which fell to 44 . \n",
      "5 billion dlrs in 1986 from 46 . \n",
      "8 billion in 1985 , is still among the largest in Asia . \n",
      "\" This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development ... Last year was a major turning point for the Korean economy ,\" Kim said . \n",
      "Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the country ' s GNP to about 20 pct in 1991 , from about 50 pct in 1986 . \n",
      "\" The government , however , does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus ,\" he said . \n",

      "COCOA DEAL SEEN POSITIVE , BUT NO PRICE GUARANTEE The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price - support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices , many ICCO delegates and trade sources said . \n",
      "The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35 - member ICCO council after two weeks of talks . \n",
      "European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately , but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long . \n",

      "Under the new rules , the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas , using price differentials to reflect different qualities . \n",

      "They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it because a big portion of Malaysia ' s cocoa exports , officially estimated at 112 , 000 tonnes in 1986 , goes to non - members . \n",
      "Most growers and traders added they are also against a buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump . \n",

      "COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks , cocoa traders said . \n",

      "Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end - April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1 , 600 SDR \" must buy \" level . \n",

      "The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market . \n",
      "But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10 - day average , the indicator which governs his activities , traders said . \n",
      "\" The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa ,\" an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said . \n",

      "In these circumstances , the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20 , 000 and 30 , 000 tonnes to lift prices above the \" must buy \" level . \n",
      "But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market . \n",
      "The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non - members could limit the buffer stock ' s scope for action , dealers said . \n",
      "Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in - store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin . \n",
      "But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member , while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day , which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material . \n",
      "Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non - member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material , traders said . \n",
      "Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures , but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures . \n",
      "Ghana ' s premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying , dealers said . \n",

      "Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were \" all prognostication \" and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be . \n",
      "Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices , but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100 , 000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus , dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure . \n",

      "\" They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time ,\" he said . \n",
      "\" On the other hand , net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time , and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment .\" Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986 / 87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct . \n",

      "Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987 / 88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand . \n",
      "He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income . \n",

      "BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS Brazil ' s recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987 . \n",
      "The developing world ' s most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans , and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets , economists said . \n",

      "But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation ,\" Aldo Roldan , Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics , said . \n",
      "Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets , but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable . \n",
      "\" Domestic costs have increased ( due to inflation ) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates ,\" Roldan said . \n",
      "The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil , where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs . \n",
      "But he added : \" They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels .\" Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee , and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world ' s largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance . \n",
      "Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) members to re - establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence . \n",

      "At the end of the talks , he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer . \n",
      "Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales , the dealer said . \n",
      "\" If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar , ninety or eighty cents ,\" he said . \n",
      "New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2 . \n",

      "\" They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been ,\" according to Richard Loewy , analyst for Prudential - Bache Securities Inc . \n",
      "Loewy believes the foreign debt problem , a good crop , plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop . \n",

      "Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan . \n",
      "\" We ' re getting into a period when they ( Brazil ) are starting to harvest and starting to export ,\" Eshleman said . \n",

      "Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops , Melicias said it would not make a big difference . \n",
      "On other commodity markets , Brazil ' s selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital . \n",
      "Brazil is faced with a poor 1986 / 87 sugar harvest , which could limit exports to the world market , analysts said . \n",
      "The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments , and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar , will give it little room to stretch exports , they said . \n",

      "29 billion , market economists polled by Reuters said . \n",
      "Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow . \n",

      "COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market , government delegates and trade experts said . \n",
      "Only two weeks ago , world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated . \n",
      "This week , many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work . \n",
      "The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council ( ITC ), which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling , is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations . \n",
      "The ITC ' s failure has restricted negotiators ' ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built - in flaws or unlimited liability , but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade . \n",
      "A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend . \n",
      "Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought . \n",
      "One consumer country delegate said this would \" distort , not support \" the market . \n",
      "Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder . \n",
      "On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows . \n",
      "The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices . \n",
      "The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the \" must buy \" level of 1 , 600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact , which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock . \n",
      "Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given . \n",
      "The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets . \n",
      "A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100 , 000 tonnes of cocoa , enough to mount large buying or selling operations , were carried forward from the previous agreement . \n",
      "Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade . \n",
      "It has an upper limit of 250 , 000 tonnes . \n",
      "The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non - member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa . \n",
      "Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters , and the full council meets on Thursday . \n",
      "Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non - member countries such as Malaysia . \n",
      "Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium - priced high quality cocoas . \n",
      "The argument over buying non - member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities . \n",
      "European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non - member cocoa and that it use the London futures market ' s existing differentials for different qualities . \n",
      "Currently , good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market . \n",
      "Discounts , which are currently under review , range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa . \n",

      "The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community , a key ICCO consumer group , with France siding with producers . \n",
      "EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and , a diplomatic source said , narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations . \n",
      "The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there . \n",
      "One ICCO delegate describing the producer / consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is \" meant to support the market where trade buying is not .\" In contrast , he said , producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers . \n",
      "Other , more technical , issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced \" posted price \" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers . \n",
      "In either case , delegates said , it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers . \n",

      "\" A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term ,\" he said , although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation . \n",

      "Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the \" leading edge \" of monetary policy , but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front . \n",
      "He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness . \n",

      "James Capel ' s Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent , Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no \" chickens coming home to roost .\" Richard Jeffrey , who favours the likelihood of a June election , said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory . \n",
